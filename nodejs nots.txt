>>very first you need to write "npm init" to get "package.json" file

>>npm stands for node package manager
>>json stands for javascript object notation

>>first you need to write "node filename(server.js)" to run the server
then you go to browser and run the server with port number

>>in javascript the very first time started version is known as vannila

>>in nodejs we use keyword require for to import the modules then access the function 
(import os from "os")

>>const path = require("path")
console.log(path.dirname(__filename))
the above example is used show the path of  file name dircetory

>>console.log(path.parse(__filename))
the above example parse is used to shown the complete object of the file name like root,ext,dir,base,name

>>if you create a new file(math.js) in nodejs how you import that file in main file?
        it is possible by const math = require("./math")
here is an example 
        filename---math.js----
const.add=(a,b)=>a+b;
module.exports ={add}//it is use to export the file which mean ethrumathi

        filename---server.js----
const math= require("./math");
console.log(math.add(2,3))


>>HTTP response status codes
HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.
Responses are grouped in five classes:

>>in package.json you can overwrite the script,instead of previous one you can write "start" : "node server.js"
because you don't need to wwrite node server.js again and again in terminal, by using script you use write just"npm start" 
in terminal

>>Nodemon-It is use to auto retart the node application when changes have done in code, 
by use nodemon we don't need to kill and start our application again and again.
We need nodemon you must install it buy usind "npm i nodemon" in your terminal

>>By installing nodemon is not only enough to run appilation automatically, you need to add some stuff
in package.json in script "dev":"nodemon server.js" if you want to use nodemon in terminal to run 
application just write "npm run dev" if you write one time that enough if you save your changes in code 
it automatically run your node application

>>HTTp methods

>>if you want to work others why we use thunder extention

>>res.writeHead()-it is use to http response eg:-res.writeHead(200)
>>res.write()-it is used to get output in browser

>>use thunder client to access different methods like post delete put patch

>>API-Application Programming INterface, if you run your application you need API
because api intract with frontend and backend 
eg:-if you get data from database to the UI you can get data with the help of API
